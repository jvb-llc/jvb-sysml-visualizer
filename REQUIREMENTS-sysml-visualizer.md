# jvb-sysml-visualizer Requirements

This document outlines the detailed requirements for the `jvb-sysml-visualizer` project using the Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax (EARS).

## Functional Requirements

*   **F-1 (Data Loading):** The `jvb-sysml-visualizer` shall load SysML data from the Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) binary format generated by the `jvb-sysml-analyzer`.
*   **F-2 (Block Diagram Rendering):** The `jvb-sysml-visualizer` shall render SysML Block Diagrams, including blocks, ports, and connectors.
*   **F-3 (Internal Block Diagram Rendering):** The `jvb-sysml-visualizer` shall render SysML Internal Block Diagrams, showing the internal structure of blocks.
*   **F-4 (Panning and Zooming):** The user shall be able to pan and zoom within the rendered diagrams to navigate large models.
*   **F-5 (Element Selection):** The user shall be able to select individual elements in the diagram (e.g., blocks, ports).
*   **F-6 (Property Display):** When an element is selected, the `jvb-sysml-visualizer` shall display its properties (e.g., name, type, definition).

## Non-Functional Requirements

*   **NF-1 (Performance):** The WASM application shall load and render a medium-sized SysML model (e.g., 100 blocks) in under 2 seconds.
*   **NF-2 (Browser Compatibility):** The `jvb-sysml-visualizer` shall be compatible with the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
*   **NF-3 (Integration):** The visualizer shall provide a clear API for the `jvb-cli` to embed and interact with it.
*   **NF-4 (Build System):** The C++ project shall use CMake as its build system.
*   **NF-5 (Dependencies):** The project shall use a C++ package manager (e.g., Conan or vcpkg) to manage external dependencies.
*   **NF-6 (Protobuf Compilation):** The build system shall include a step to compile `.proto` files into C++ source code using the `protoc` compiler.

## Architectural Requirements

*   **A-1 (Frontend/Backend Separation):** The C++ codebase shall be structured to logically separate the frontend rendering logic from the backend data processing logic.
*   **A-2 (Data Interface):** The data interface between the `jvb-sysml-analyzer` and the `jvb-sysml-visualizer` shall be defined in a set of version-controlled `.proto` files.
