# jvb-sysml-visualizer Requirements

This document outlines the detailed requirements for the `jvb-sysml-visualizer` project using the Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax (EARS).

## Functional Requirements

*   **F-1 (Data Loading):** The `jvb-sysml-visualizer` shall load SysML data from the Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) binary format generated by the `jvb-sysml-analyzer`.
*   **F-2 (2D Block Diagram Rendering):** The `jvb-sysml-visualizer` shall render interactive 2D SysML Block Diagrams, including blocks, ports, and connectors.
*   **F-3 (2D Internal Block Diagram Rendering):** The `jvb-sysml-visualizer` shall render interactive 2D SysML Internal Block Diagrams, showing the internal structure of blocks.
*   **F-4 (2D Navigation):** The user shall be able to pan, zoom, and navigate the 2D diagrams using standard mouse and keyboard controls.
*   **F-5 (Element Selection):** The user shall be able to select individual elements in the diagram (e.g., blocks, ports).
*   **F-6 (Property Display):** When an element is selected, the `jvb-sysml-visualizer` shall display its properties (e.g., name, type, definition).
*   **F-7 (3D Breakouts):** The user shall be able to select a component in a 2D diagram and view it as an interactive 3D model.
*   **F-8 (Diagram Drill-Down):** When a user double-clicks on a diagram element that represents a subsystem with more detailed diagrams available, the `jvb-sysml-visualizer` shall navigate into and display the detailed diagram of that subsystem, maintaining the context of the parent diagram.
*   **F-9 (Navigation Controls):** The `jvb-sysml-visualizer` shall provide clear navigation controls (e.g., breadcrumbs, "zoom out" button) to allow the user to easily return to higher-level diagrams.

## Non-Functional Requirements

*   **NF-1 (Performance):** The WASM application shall load and render a medium-sized SysML model (e.g., 100 blocks) in under 2 seconds.
*   **NF-2 (Browser Compatibility):** The `jvb-sysml-visualizer` shall be compatible with the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
*   **NF-3 (Integration):** The visualizer shall provide a clear API for the `jvb-cli` to embed and interact with it.
*   **NF-4 (Build System):** The C++ project shall use CMake as its build system.
*   **NF-5 (Dependencies):** The project shall use a C++ package manager (e.g., Conan or vcpkg) to manage external dependencies.
*   **NF-6 (Protobuf Compilation):** The build system shall include a step to compile `.proto` files into C++ source code using the `protoc` compiler.
*   **NF-7 (3D Rendering):** The visualization shall be implemented using a 3D rendering library suitable for C++ and WASM (e.g., Sokol Gfx, bgfx).
*   **NF-8 (UI):** All UI elements (e.g., property panels, buttons) shall be created using the ImGui immediate mode GUI library.
*   **NF-9 (Embedded Rendering):** For development and integration with `jvb-dev` outside of a full web browser, the `jvb-sysml-visualizer` shall support rendering its WASM frontend using the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF).

## Architectural Requirements

*   **A-1 (Strict IP Separation):** To protect intellectual property, the `jvb-sysml-visualizer` shall be architected with a strict separation between a "backend" component (containing proprietary SysML processing logic) and a "frontend" WASM component (containing non-proprietary rendering logic).
*   **A-2 (Data Interface):** The data interface between the `jvb-sysml-analyzer`, the visualizer's backend, and the visualizer's frontend shall be defined in a set of version-controlled `.proto` files.
*   **A-3 (Backend Data Generation):** The backend component shall be solely responsible for processing the incoming SysML data and generating a set of simple, non-proprietary rendering instructions (e.g., draw a box at X,Y; draw a line from A to B) for the frontend. No SysML-specific data or logic shall be exposed to the frontend component that is downloaded by the user's browser.

## Challenges to be Addressed

*   **CH-1 (Build Toolchain):** The combination of C++, CMake, a C++ package manager, Protobuf, and Emscripten (for WASM compilation) creates a complex build environment that must be robust and easy for developers to use.
*   **CH-2 (3D Library Selection):** A final decision on the 3D rendering library is required. The chosen library must be lightweight, performant in WASM, and have a suitable license.
*   **CH-3 (ImGui Integration):** A robust integration between the chosen 3D library and ImGui must be created, including handling user input from the browser or CEF environment.
*   **CH-4 (CEF Integration Strategy):** A clear strategy is needed for how the Chromium Embedded Framework will be used. This includes build/linking, how the native C++ 'backend' communicates with the WASM 'frontend' running inside CEF, and how to create a seamless user experience.
*   **CH-5 (IP Separation Enforcement):** A technical strategy must be defined to enforce the strict frontend/backend separation within a single C++ project, ensuring no proprietary code is accidentally compiled into the distributable WASM frontend.
*   **CH-6 (Protobuf Schema Design):** The initial version of the `.proto` schema must be designed. This schema is a critical interface between three components (Haskell analyzer, C++ backend, C++ frontend) and must be carefully considered.
*   **CH-7 (2D-in-3D Rendering Strategy):** A decision must be made on how to implement the 2D diagram rendering on top of a 3D library (e.g., orthographic projection vs. a dedicated 2D abstraction) to ensure both performance and ease of implementation.
*   **CH-8 (Interactive Event Handling):** Implementing robust and responsive event handling for mouse (e.g., double-click for drill-down, click-and-drag for panning) and keyboard controls within the WASM environment, especially considering potential interactions with ImGui and the underlying 3D library.
*   **CH-9 (Hierarchical Data Representation for Navigation):** The Protobuf schema needs to effectively represent the hierarchical structure of SysML models to support drill-down and drill-up navigation, ensuring that the necessary contextual information is available at each level of detail.
